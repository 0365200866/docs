# Connect Apps to Amazon

The Amazon social connection allow users to log in to your application using their Amazon profile.

By default, Auth0 automatically syncs user profile data with each user login, thereby ensuring that changes made in the connection source are automatically updated in Auth0. Optionally, you can [disable user profile data synchronization](/users/configure-connection-sync-with-auth0) to allow for updating profile attributes from your application.
