### Set up app in Google

1. Log in to [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
2. From the projects list, select a project or create a new one.
3. If the APIs & services page is already open, open the console left side menu and select **APIs & services**.
4. Click **Credentials**.
5. Click **New Credentials**, then select **OAuth client ID**.
6. On the **OAuth consent screen**, under **Authorized domains**, add `auth0.com`.
7. Select **Web application** and complete form including the following information: 

| Field | Description |
| - | - |
| Authorized JavaScript origins | `https://${account.namespace}` |
| Authorized redirect URIs | `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback` |

::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, your regional subdomain (unless your tenant is in the US region and was created before June 2020), plus`.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com` and your redirect URI would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com/login/callback`. (If your tenant is in the US and was created before June 2020, then your domain name would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com`.)

If you are using [custom domains](https://auth0.com/docs/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.

::: warning
If your application requests sensitive OAuth <dfn data-key="scope">scopes</dfn>, it may be [subject to review by Google](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/client-verification).
