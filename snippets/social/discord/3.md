### Set up app in Discord
Set up an app in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers):
1. Navigate to [Applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications), and click **New Application**.
2. Enter an application name, and click **Create**. Discord will generate a **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for your application; make note of these.
3. In the left menu, click **OAuth2**.
While setting up your app, make sure you use the following settings:
| Field | Value to Provide |
| - | - |
| Redirect URI | `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback` |
| Scopes | Select `identify`. |
::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name for redirects
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, plus `.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com` and your redirect URI would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com/login/callback`.

If you are using [custom domains](/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">callback URL</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
