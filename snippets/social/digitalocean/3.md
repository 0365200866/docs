### Set up app in DigitalOcean
Set up an app in DigitalOcean using DigitalOcean's [Using OAuth Authentication with DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-oauth-authentication-with-digitalocean-as-a-user-or-developer#registering-developer-applications-with-digitalocean) documentation. During this process, DigitalOcean will generate a **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for your application; make note of these.
While setting up your app, make sure you use the following settings:
| Field | Value to Provide |
| - | - |
| Callback URL | `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback` |
::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name for redirects
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, plus `.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com` and your callback URL would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com/login/callback`.

If you are using [custom domains](/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">callback URL</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
