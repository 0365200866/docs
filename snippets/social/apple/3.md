## Set up app in Apple

Set up an app in the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com) using Apple's [Sign in with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/get-started/) documentation. 

While setting up your app, note the following IDs and keys:
    * Services ID (Client ID)
    * Apple Team ID
    * Client Secret Signing Key
    * Key ID
    
::: note
If you are using the Classic Universal Login flow or embedding `Lock.js` in your application, make sure you are using `Lock.js` version 11.16 or later.

::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, your regional subdomain (unless your tenant is in the US region and was created before June 2020), plus`.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com` and your callback URL would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com/login/callback`. (If your tenant is in the US and was created before June 2020, then your domain name would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com`.)

If you are using [custom domains](https://auth0.com/docs/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">callback URL</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
