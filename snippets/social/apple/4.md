### Create and enable connection in Auth0

Once you have the credentials you need from your Apple Developer account, you must configure the connection settings and enable the connection for your application in Auth0. You can complete these tasks using either the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://auth0.com/docs/dashboard/guides/connections/set-up-connections-social) or Management API [Create a Connection endpoint](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/#!/Connections/post_connections).
