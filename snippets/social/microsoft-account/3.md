### Set up app in Microsoft Account

1. Follow the instructions in [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform (Preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).
2. While setting up your app, when asked to set a **Redirect URI**, enter your <dfn data-key="callback">callback URL</dfn>:
  `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback`

::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, your regional subdomain (unless your tenant is in the US region and was created before June 2020), plus`.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com` and your redirect URI would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com/login/callback`. (If your tenant is in the US and was created before June 2020, then your domain name would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com`.)

If you are using [custom domains](https://auth0.com/docs/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.

Microsoft will generate an **Application (client) ID** for your application. You can find this on the app's **Overview** screen.
