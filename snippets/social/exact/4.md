### Create and enable connection in Auth0

[Set up the Exact social connection](https://auth0.com/docs/dashboard/guides/connections/set-up-connections-social) in Auth0. Make sure you have the generated **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

You can register applications in multiple regions with Exact. By default, Auth0 will use `https://start.exactonline.nl`, but this value can be overridden with the `Base URL` parameter.
