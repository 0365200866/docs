# Configure SSO Integration for Workday

The Workday [Single Sign-on (SSO)](/sso) Integration creates a client application that uses Auth0 for authentication and provides SSO capabilities for Workday. Your users log in to Workday with Auth0 [identity providers](/identityproviders), which means the identity provider performs the identity credentials verification.
