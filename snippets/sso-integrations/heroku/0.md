# Configure SSO Integration for Heroku

The Heroku [Single Sign-on (SSO)](/sso) Integration creates a client application that uses Auth0 for authentication and provides SSO capabilities for Heroku. Your users log in to Heroku with Auth0 [identity providers](/identityproviders), which means the identity provider performs the identity credentials verification.
