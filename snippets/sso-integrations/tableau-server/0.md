# Configure SSO Integration for Tableau Server

The Tableau Server [Single Sign-on (SSO)](/sso) Integration creates a client application that uses Auth0 for authentication and provides SSO capabilities for Tableau Server. Your users log in to Tableau Server with Auth0 [identity providers](/identityproviders), which means the identity provider performs the identity credentials verification.
