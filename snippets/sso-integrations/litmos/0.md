# Configure SSO Integration for Litmos

The Litmos [Single Sign-on (SSO)](/sso) Integration creates a client application that uses Auth0 for authentication and provides SSO capabilities for Litmos. Your users log in to Litmos with Auth0 [identity providers](/identityproviders), which means the identity provider performs the identity credentials verification.
