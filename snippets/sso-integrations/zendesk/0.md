# Configure SSO Integration for Zendesk

The Zendesk [Single Sign-on (SSO)](/sso) Integration creates a client application that uses Auth0 for authentication and provides SSO capabilities for Zendesk. Your users log in to Zendesk with Auth0 [identity providers](/identityproviders), which means the identity provider performs the identity credentials verification.
