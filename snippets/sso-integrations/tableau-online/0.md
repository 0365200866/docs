# Configure SSO Integration for Tableau Online

The Tableau Online [Single Sign-on (SSO)](/sso) Integration creates a client application that uses Auth0 for authentication and provides SSO capabilities for Tableau Online. Your users log in to Tableau Online with Auth0 [identity providers](/identityproviders), which means the identity provider performs the identity credentials verification.
