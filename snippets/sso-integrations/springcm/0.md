# Configure SSO Integration for SpringCM

The SpringCM [Single Sign-on (SSO)](/sso) Integration creates a client application that uses Auth0 for authentication and provides SSO capabilities for SpringCM. Your users log in to SpringCM with Auth0 [identity providers](/identityproviders), which means the identity provider performs the identity credentials verification.
