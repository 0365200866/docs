# Configure SSO Integration for Sprout Video

The Sprout Video [Single Sign-on (SSO)](/sso) Integration creates a client application that uses Auth0 for authentication and provides SSO capabilities for Sprout Video. Your users log in to Sprout Video with Auth0 [identity providers](/identityproviders), which means the identity provider performs the identity credentials verification.
