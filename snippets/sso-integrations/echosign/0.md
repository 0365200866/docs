# Configure SSO Integration for EchoSign

The EchoSign [Single Sign-on (SSO)](/sso) Integration creates a client application that uses Auth0 for authentication and provides SSO capabilities for EchoSign. Your users log in to EchoSign with Auth0 [identity providers](/identityproviders), which means the identity provider performs the identity credentials verification.
