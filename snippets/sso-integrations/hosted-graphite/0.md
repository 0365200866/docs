# Configure SSO Integration for Hosted Graphite

The Hosted Graphite [Single Sign-on (SSO)](/sso) Integration creates a client application that uses Auth0 for authentication and provides SSO capabilities for Hosted Graphite. Your users log in to Hosted Graphite with Auth0 [identity providers](/identityproviders), which means the identity provider performs the identity credentials verification.
