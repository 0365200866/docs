# Configure SSO Integration for Pluralsight

The Pluralsight [Single Sign-on (SSO)](/sso) Integration creates a client application that uses Auth0 for authentication and provides SSO capabilities for Pluralsight. Your users log in to Pluralsight with Auth0 [identity providers](/identityproviders), which means the identity provider performs the identity credentials verification.
