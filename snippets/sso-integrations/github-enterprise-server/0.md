# Configure SSO Integration for GitHub Enterprise Server

The GitHub Enterprise Server [Single Sign-on (SSO)](/sso) Integration creates a client application that uses Auth0 for authentication and provides SSO capabilities for GitHub Enterprise Server. Your users log in to GitHub Enterprise Server with Auth0 [identity providers](/identityproviders), which means the identity provider performs the identity credentials verification.
