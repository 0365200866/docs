## Basic areas to check and verify first

There are a few [basic](/troubleshoot/concepts/basics) areas to check and verify before you submit a support ticket. These areas include Auth0 system status, your platform, connections, domain, rules, and deprecations.  

## Troubleshooting tools

You should use [Auth0 Logs](/logs) and [HAR Files](/troubleshoot/guides/generate-har-files) to help track down the causes for issues. You can also [validate JSON Web Tokens](/tokens/guides/jwt/validate-jwt). The [Authentication API Debugger](/extensions/authorization-extension/v2/troubleshooting) extension allows you to test various endpoints of the Auth0 Authentication API.
