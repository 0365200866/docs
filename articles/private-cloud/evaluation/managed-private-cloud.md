# Managed Private Cloud

Users with requirements not met by the Auth0 Public Cloud may instead opt for one of the Private Cloud deployment options.

Auth0 currently offers two Private Cloud deployment models:

* Private Cloud
* **Managed** Private Cloud, either hosted by Auth0 or hosted by you on an AWS environment and operated by Auth0 as a managed service

This overview covers specifically the **Managed Private Cloud** option.

## What is the Managed Private Cloud?

Auth0's Managed Private Cloud (MPC) offering is a specially customized Auth0 deployment that allows you greater flexibility and increased input when it comes to day-to-day operations. As an MPC customer, you will be more involved with all aspects of your Auth0 deployment.

## Benefits of the Managed Private Cloud

With a Managed Private Cloud, we will work closely with you to make sure that all aspects of your Auth0 environment and deployment are tuned to best meet the needs of your business.
