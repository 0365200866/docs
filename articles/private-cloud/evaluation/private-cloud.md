# Private Cloud

Users with requirements not met by the Auth0 Public Cloud may instead opt for one of the Private Cloud deployment options.

Auth0 currently offers two Private Cloud deployment models:

* Private Cloud
* **Managed** Private Cloud, either hosted by Auth0 or hosted by you on an AWS environment and operated by Auth0 as a managed service

This overview covers specifically the **Private Cloud** option.

## What is the Private Cloud?

The Private Cloud provides you with a dedicated (or single-tenant) environment. You'll get enhanced performance, security, and compliance over what we include in our standard Public Cloud offering.

With the Private Cloud, Auth0 will handle a majority of the requirements for initial setup and maintenance. Afterward, you'll be on a set update pattern, typically no more frequent than every 30 days.

You'll get the ease of management that comes with using our Public Cloud combined with the power and security of our [Managed Private Cloud](/private-cloud/managed-private-cloud).
