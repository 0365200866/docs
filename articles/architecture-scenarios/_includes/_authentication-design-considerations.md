Itâ€™s important to consider both security and user experience when designing how you will authenticate your users, and so there are a number of things you will want to consider when looking at functionality and workflow:

* Where will users enter their credentials?
* How you will keep user credentials safe?
* How you will maintain your authentication system?
* How you will provide password authentication for your users?
* How you will prevent hackers from trying to log in as your users?
* How you want to implement authentication in different kinds of applications using Auth0?
* What to do if you want to make login easy for your users when they come from different language backgrounds?
* How you will provide a good user experience as you migrate away from any legacy authentication system?
* What do you need to consider when integrating your applications with Auth0?
* Can your users log in using their existing social (e.g., Facebook or Google) accounts?
