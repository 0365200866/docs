Understanding your application is key to understanding how Auth0 can be leveraged to meet your needs. From experience, our most successful customers start with a visualization of their proposed - or in many cases existing - architecture and use this as a basis for reference as they progress. Auth0 [Accounts and Tenants](/getting-started/the-basics#account-and-tenants) form the basis for the grouping and structuring of Auth0 assets, and it may be that youâ€™ll need to leverage an existing Auth0 deployment in order to integrate with Single Sign On (SSO), centralized user profile management, and consolidated billing.
