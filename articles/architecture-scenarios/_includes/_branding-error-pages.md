If there are issues encountered during user interactive workflow (e.g. user sign up or login), Auth0 provides error messages that indicate what the problem is under the hood. The default messages are somewhat cryptic, especially to the end user, since they will likely be missing context that only you can supply. As such, we recommend [customizing your error pages](/universal-login/custom-error-pages) to provide the missing context-specific information directly to your users. Furthermore, customizing your error pages allows you to display your branding, not Auth0's, as well as provide useful information to your users as to what should be done next. This information might include a link to a FAQ or how to get in touch with your company's support team or help desk.
