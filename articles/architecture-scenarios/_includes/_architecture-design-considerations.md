The value of investing time on the landscape of the architecture up-front is something that we have found pays dividends in the long run, and there are a number of things you will want to consider when looking at functionality and workflow:

* What should the URL look like to the user when Auth0 presents a web page?
* How can Auth0 be implemented to support our SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle)?
* How can I ensure that my Auth0 Tenants are appropriately associated with my contract?
* What do I need to consider if there are other projects in my organization integrating with Auth0? Particularly projects that target their own, or a different domain of users (for example, applications that only employees will use)?
