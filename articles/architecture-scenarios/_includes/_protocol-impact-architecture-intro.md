For customer facing applications we typically see [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](/protocols/oidc) as being the most frequently used protocol. OIDC makes use of web based workflows with browser URLs that are presented to the user. Out-of-the-box, client facing URLs as part of Auth0 OIDC support are Auth0 branded, however we recommend using the Auth0 [custom domain](#custom-domains) capability to provide for consistent corporate identity and to also address potential user confidence concerns before they arise.
