Auth0 can be customized with a look and feel that aligns with your organization's brand requirements and user expectations.

Branding Auth0 collateral provides a consistent look and feel to the user experience for your customers and gives them peace of mind that they’re using a product from a trusted and secure provider.

Auth0 also provides support for [internationalization (I18N)](/i18n) and localization (L10N), both of which are important if you work with an international clientele. Out-of-box collateral, such as the Auth0 Lock UI widget, comes ready enabled for multiple language support, with built-in extensibility for adding more languages if what you require [doesn’t already exist](/libraries/lock/v11/i18n).

Almost all applications need Internationalization and/or Localization in one form or another. Auth0 makes it easy to add, but you need to account for it up front: retro-fitting localization, for example, can be a painful process if left too late.
