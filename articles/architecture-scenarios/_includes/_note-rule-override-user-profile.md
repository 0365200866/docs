::: note
The Normalized User Profile is updated from the identity provider during login, and a limited set of the information it contains can be changed through the Auth0 Management API. Auth0 extensibility, such as Rules, can be used as an alternative to [override information in the Normalized User Profile](/users/concepts/overview-user-profile#user-profile-data-modification).
