In addition to hosting the [User Profile](/architecture-scenarios/implementation/b2c/b2c-profile-mgmt), Auth0 also has the capability to both proxy your own legacy identity store as well as provide a secure Auth0 hosted replacement. Both of these capabilities are supported via the use of Auth0 [Database Connections](/identityproviders#database-and-custom-connections). If you decide to use Auth0 as a replacement for your legacy identity store then you can migrate users either en-mass via [Bulk Migration](users/concepts/overview-user-migration#bulk-user-imports-with-the-management-api), or progressively using [Automatic Migration](users/concepts/overview-user-migration#automatic-migrations).  

::: panel Best Practice
Customers often opt for a two-stage approach to user migration, employing Automatic Migration in the first instance in order to migrate as many users as possible, and then performing Bulk Migration for the users that remain. For further details on migration scenarios see the [Auth0 documentation](users/references/user-migration-scenarios). 
:::

Automatic Migration is preferred as it allows users to be migrated in a piecemeal fashion, and also allows them to retain their existing password. For Bulk Migration we recommend the use of the [Management API](api/management/v2#!/Jobs/post_users_imports) over use of the [User Import/Export extension](/users/concepts/overview-user-migration#migrate-users-with-the-user-import-export-extension) in all but the most simple cases, as the Management API provides for greater flexibility and control. With Bulk Migration users will typically need to **reset their password once migration is complete**.
