In order to provide services to your users, you must be able to identify who those users are. This process is called User  Authentication. There are a number of ways to perform authentication of a user - via social media accounts, username and password, passwordless - and it's often recommended that you go beyond a first factor for authenticating the user by adding a second factor as well (Multi-factor Authentication).
