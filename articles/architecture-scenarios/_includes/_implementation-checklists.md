Auth0 provides helpful implementation planning [checklists](/architecture-scenarios/checklists) in spreadsheet format that you can use to organize your implementation tasks. Each checklist aligns with a particular phase of a typical SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle). Not all of the items in the checklists will apply to you, however we recommend that you use the checklists as a starting point for planning and implementation.
