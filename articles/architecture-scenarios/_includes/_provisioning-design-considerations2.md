Auth0 provides out-of-the-box identity storage that can be leveraged to store user credentials safely and securely (see Auth0 [Self Sign Up](#self-sign-up) for further discussion). If you already have a legacy identity store, and you want to offload the management of it, then Auth0’s [User Migration](#user-migration) capabilities provide you with a number of options to do so.

Alternatively, if you have to stick with your legacy identity store - perhaps because you’ve got applications which you aren’t ready to migrate or which can’t be migrated - then Auth0’s [identity store proxy](#identity-store-proxy) capability is exactly what you need. Allowing your customers to use “bring your own identity” is also an attractive proposition. Though we find our customers don’t typically do so from the get-go, Auth0’s [Social Sign Up](#social-sign-up) capability is exactly what you’ll need when you’re ready to provide it.
