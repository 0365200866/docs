User metadata (also referred to as `user_metadata`) is information that can be stored against a user profile and that a user can read and update as part of any self-service profile management. Metadata of this nature may be something like salutation for a user, or a userâ€™s preferred language (which could be used to [customize the emails](/email/templates#common-variables) sent by Auth0).
