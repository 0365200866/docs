Establishing effective operational behaviors is something that successful customers have found pays dividends, and there are a number of things you will want to consider when looking at your workflow:

*	What should I be doing to proactively detect failures?
*	What do I need to know regarding how to obtain data on Auth0’s operational status?
*	What should I be doing about Auth0 security bulletins related to the Auth0 service?
*	Does Auth0 provide information regarding impending changes in the Auth0 service?
*	How can I check for important notices from Auth0?
*	What should I be doing about Auth0 log data so that I can analyze it and keep it for longer than Auth0’s limited data retention period?
*	Can I scan Auth0 logs to determine if peak loads in my application trigger any rate limits or other errors?
*	What email services should I be using to support production volumes of email messages to users? Why can’t I use Auth0's out-of-box email provider in my production environment?
*	Why would I need to configure my firewall, and what firewall ports will I need to open for internal services that need to receive communications from Auth0 (such as custom databases, web services, and email servers)?
