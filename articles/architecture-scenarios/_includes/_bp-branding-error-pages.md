Out-of-the-box there is no user interface for customizing Auth0 provided error pages, but you can use the [Tenant Settings endpoint of the Management API](/api/management/v2#!/Tenants/patch_settings) to configure them. Alternatively, if you can create and host your own error page, then you can have Auth0 direct users to that page instead of using the Auth0-hosted option.
