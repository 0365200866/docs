Your application may need to support a user’s request to remove their account (for example, you might need to meet [GDPR](https://eugdpr.org/) requirements). You can implement such a feature, along with a number of other profile-related functions, using the [Management API](/api/management/v2#!/Users). The Management API allows you to retrieve information stored about a user and update it as required.

Auth0 is capable of supporting various privacy-related requirements, including the display of links to consent notices on signup and data protection to support the rights of users to view and correct data you’ve collected about them.
