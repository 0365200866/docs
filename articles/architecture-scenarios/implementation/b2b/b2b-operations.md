## Self-Service IDP provisioning

Auth0 makes it easy to configure IDPs, but depending on the number of organizations and the amount of coordination work with those organizations, it can be a time consuming process to onboard several new customer organization IDPs regularly.  As a result, many of our customers have found it worth the time and effort to build a self-service portal for the administrators of their customers' organization so that they can configure their own IDP instead of having your IT department have to work with them.  Auth0â€™s Management API provides all of the necessary functionality to support your UI.
