# Implementation Resources

Auth0 provides a wealth of resources to assist you. This list provides links to the resources available, by category, and helps you engage effectively with Auth0.  

## Get started

The following resources are designed to help you learn the basics of Auth0.

* [**Getting Started documentation**](/getting-started): Explore the Auth0 Dashboard and common terms used for components of the Auth0 service. This information is useful for a broad understanding of Auth0 as well as terms you might hear when working with Auth0 staff or reading documentation.

* [**Architecture scenarios**](/architecture-scenarios): Descriptions of common architecture scenarios and how to implement them with Auth0, including tutorials for common architecture patterns such as a Single Page Application calling an API. The high-level descriptions will be useful for architects and the tutorials will be helpful for development teams.

* [**Implementation guides**](/topics/guides): Guides and conceptual information for commonly used features such as user management and multi-factor authentication. This information is useful for architects and developers.

* [**How to have a successful IDM Project blog post**](https://auth0.com/blog/how-to-have-a-successful-idm-project/): Learn how to create a realistic project plan to have a good Identity Management project deployment.

## Learn

Auth0 provides numerous tutorials, guides, white papers, and blog posts with both learning and quick reference checks in mind. See the menu to the left for our documentation that covers a wealth of topics. You can browse through the available topics or use our search to quickly find content related to a topic or term. 

* [**Feature descriptions and white papers**](https://auth0.com/learn/): The Auth0 Learn site features short descriptions of features, industry case studies, and reference white papers. This site is useful to get a quick overview of Auth0 features and business value of each and is helpful for project owners as well as architects and developers.

* [**Blog posts**](https://auth0.com/blog/): See blog posts by experts on a variety of topics - from time-honored advice to breaking news in the identity space. Many blog posts are oreneted toward architects and developers. 

## Run sample code

Once your development team is ready to build, Auth0 provides many sample programs, SDKs, and libraries to speed your project along.

* [**Quickstarts**](/quickstarts): Auth0 provides a rich array of quickstarts - small sample programs that demonstrate how to do the key features you’ll want to implement in your program such as authentication, session management, profile updates and logout to name a few of the examples available. The quickstarts will give developers a head start on understanding how to integrate applications with Auth0.

* [**Libraries and SDKs**](/libraries): Auth0 provides an extensive set of libraries and SDKs to support those developing custom applications by abstracting many of the details of the identity protocols for you. The Auth0 SDK supports numerous languages and frameworks to simplify your development and integration with Auth0. There is also a Lock library which provides a login widget for use across several platforms including iOS and Android mobile platforms.

* [**Management API**](/api/management/v2): The Management API allows you to manage objects, configuration, and settings within Auth0. Developers find the Management API Explorer useful to test out the Management API before coding API calls into your application and quickly manipulate individual objects on an *ad-hoc* basis.

* [**Authentication API**](/api/authentication): The Authentication API supports authentication and authorization via the OIDC, OAuth, and SAML protocols. The Authentication API explorer allows you to experiment with the Authentication API.  Developers can quickly experiment with and test API calls before coding them into your applications.

## Try out features and API calls

Throughout Auth0, you will find **TRY** buttons and links that allow you to quickly try out a feature. These buttons are provided for connections, rules, hooks, and email templates.

* [**Authentication API Explorer**](/api/authentication#introduction): The Authentication API Explorer allows you to experiment with API calls to test them before coding them into your applications. 

* [**Management API Explorer**](/api/management/v2): The Management API Explorer allows you to experiment with API calls to manage objects, configuration, and settings within Auth0 to test them before coding them  into your application or to quickly manipulate individual objects on an *ad-hoc* basis.

* [**Postman Collections**](/api/postman): For fans of Postman, there are Postman Collections for the Auth0 APIs that provide another way to try out API calls.

## Get help

* [**Auth0 Community forum**](https://community.auth0.com/): The Auth0 Community forum connects you with the world of Auth0 via Auth0 posts, FAQs, and Q&As within the community. Architects and developers find this a valuable source of information for learning and connecting with others as well as getting help on issues.

* [**Support Center**](https://support.auth0.com/): Use the Auth0 Support Center to view and manage your subscription and tenants, file or view support requests, run an automated production check on a tenant, and view compliance information. Paying customers will find the support center a valuable resource if an issue or question cannot be solved by documentation or by searching the forum.

  * [**Create support cases**](/support/tickets): Create and file a support case if you need help.
  
  * [**Support Plans and Service Level Agreements**](/support#defect-responses): Learn about the multiple levels of support available for purchase.

  * [**Troubleshooting tips**](/onboarding/enterprise-support#what-to-check-before-logging-an-issue) and [**Information to include in your support case**](/onboarding/enterprise-support#information-to-provide-when-logging-an-issue): Get advice to help your development and support teams get to the bottom of issues.

* [**Supported versions**](/support/matrix): Understand which versions of SDKs, browswers, and languages are supported. Architects and developers should use this to ensure your project uses supported languages, libraries, and SDKs. 

* [**Feedback Portal**](https://auth0.com/feedback): Make product suggestions using the Feedback Portal or the Support Center if you want  better visibility into what you’ve filed over time. Architects and developers can use this site to provide feedback on the Auth0 product for consideration as enhancements in the future.

* [**Professional Services**](/services): Our world-wide professional services team is ready to help speed your project to success. Project owners will find this useful for learning how Auth0 identity experts can help accelerate your project or fill in any temporary skill gaps. 

## Setup and monitor operations

* [**Pre-launch advice**](/pre-deployment) and [**Production check**](/pre-deployment/how-to-run-test): Get tips and tools to help you plan your launch. Project managers as well as the development and operations teams should go through these resources to leverage advice for a smooth launch.  

* [**Operational policies**](/policies): Familiarize yourself with our  policies so you know the lead times for operational requests. The policies are useful for an entire team, but project owners and operations teams especially should be aware of Auth0's operational policies.

* [**Status Dashboard**](/https://status.auth0.com): Our Status Dashboard provides status on Auth0 availability. You can subscribe to status updates. Although rare, if there is a service interruption, Auth0 conducts a root cause analysis and publishes the results on this site. Operations and support teams should be familiar with how to check the Auth0 status.

* [**Monitor endpoints**](/monitoring/how-to-monitor-auth0): We provide monitoring endpoints that you can integrate into your monitoring infrastructure. This information is of particular use to operations teams and project owners.

* [**Log data**](/logs): Learn about the types of logs Auth0 provides,  information on data retention, and tools for exporting log data to external analytical tools for analysis and long-term data retention. This information is useful for developers and operations teams as well as compliance teams interested in data retention.

* [**Dashboard Notices**](/architecture-scenarios/implementation/b2c/b2c-operations#notifications): From time to time, Auth0 sends important announcements to your Auth0 dashboard, and depending on the severity of the information, to your registered Auth0 Dashboard Admins via email. You should make a regular practice of logging in to the Dashboard and checking the bell icon at the top for any important notices.
