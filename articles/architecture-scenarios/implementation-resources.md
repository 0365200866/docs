# Implementation Resources

Auth0 provides a wealth of services to assist you. This page lists the resources available to you, by category. 

The objective of this list is to provide awareness of the resources available and help you engage most effectively with Auth0.

## Get started

The following resources are designed to help you quickly learn the basics of Auth0.

### Getting Started resources 

An [overview of Auth0](/getting-started), the Auth0 Dashboard, and common terms used for components of the Auth0 service. This page is useful for a broad understanding of Auth0 as well as terms you might hear when working with Auth0 staff or reading documentation. 

### Architecture scenarios 

Descriptions of [common architecture scenarios](/architecture-scenarios) and how to solve them with Auth0, including tutorials for implementing common architecture patterns such as a Single Page Application calling an API. The high-level descriptions will be useful for architects and the tutorials will be helpful for development teams.

### Implementation Guides 

[Guides and conceptual information](/topics/guides) for commonly used features such as user management and multi-factor authentication. This information will be useful for architects and developers alike.

### Blog post on how to have a good identity project 

A description of [typical and atypical requirements](https://auth0.com/blog/how-to-have-a-successful-idm-project/) to help you identify up front everything that may apply to your project.

## Learn

Auth0 provides numerous tutorials, guides, white papers, and blog posts with both learning and quick reference checks in mind.

### Documentation Pages

Auth0 provides [documentation}(https://auth0.docs) on this site that covers a wealth of topics. You can browse through the navigation, or do a search in your favorite browser for "Auth0 *topic of interest*" to quickly find content on a topic. Documentation covers architectural guidance, product documentation, API documentation, Extensibility Patterns and samples

### Feature descriptions and white papers

The [Auth0 Learn](https://auth0.com/learn/) site features short descriptions of features, industry case studies and reference white papers. This site is useful to get a quick overview of Auth0 features and business value of each and will be helpful for project owners as well as architects and developers.

### Blog posts 

[Blog posts](https://auth0.com/blog/) by experts on a variety of topics - from time-honored advice to breaking news in the identity space. Many blog posts are oriented toward architects and developers.

## Run sample code

Once your development team is ready to build, Auth0 provides many sample programs, SDKs, and libraries to speed your project along.

* [**Quickstarts**](/quickstarts): Auth0 provides a rich array of quickstarts - small sample programs that demonstrate how to do the key features you’ll want to implement in your program such as authentication, session management, profile updates and logout to name a few of the examples available. The quickstarts will give developers a head start on understanding how to integrate applications with Auth0.

* [**Libraries and SDKs**](/libraries): Auth0 provides an extensive set of libraries and SDKs to support those developing custom applications by abstracting many of the details of the identity protocols for you. The libraries and SDKs will greatly simplify the work of developers to adopt OIDC and OAuth in your programs and integrate with Auth0.

### SDKs

Auth0 provides an [Auth0 SDK](/libraries) for numerous languages and frameworks to simplify your development and integration with Auth0. There is also a Lock library which provides a login widget across several platforms including iOS and Android mobile platforms.

### Management API 

The [Management API](/api/management/v2 ) allows you to manage objects, configuration and settings within Auth0. Developers will find the Management API Explorer useful to test out the management API before coding API calls into your application or to quickly manipulate individual objects on an ad-hoc basis.

### Authentication API

The [Authentication API](/api/authentication) supports authentication and authorization via the OIDC, OAuth, and SAML protocols. The Authentication API explorer allows you to experiment with the Authentication API.  Developers can quickly experiment with and test API calls before coding them into your applications.

## Try things quickly

Auth0 provides **TRY** capabilities and API explorers to help you quickly test out a feature or API.

Throughout Auth0, you will find a **TRY** capability that enables you to quickly try out a feature.  These are provided for connections, rules, hooks, and email templates. You’ll see a **TRY** button or link or a triangle icon button.

### Authentication API Explorer 

The [Authentication API Explorer](/api/authentication#introduction) allows you to experiment with Authentication calls.  This lets you quickly test them out before coding them into your applications.

### Management API Explorer 

The [Management API Explorer](/api/management/v2) allows you to experiment with calls to the management API to manage objects, configuration and settings within Auth0. You can use this to test out the management API before coding API calls into your application or to quickly manipulate individual objects on an ad-hoc basis.

### Postman collection 

For fans of postman - there are [postman collections](/api/postman) for the Auth0 APIs. This provides another way to quickly try out API calls.

## Get help

### Auth0 Community forum

The [Auth0 Community forum](https://community.auth0.com/) provides a way to connect with the world of Auth0 via Auth0 posts, FAQs, and Q&A within the community. Architects and developers will find this a valuable source of information for learning and connecting with others as well as getting help on issues.

### Support Center 

The [Auth0 Support Center](https://support.auth0.com/) allows you to view and manage your subscription, tenants, file or view support requests, run an automated production check on a tenant, and view compliance information. Paying customers will find the support center a valuable resource if an issue or question cannot be solved by docs or by searching the forum.

* [**Create support case**](https://auth0.com/docs/support/tickets): Documentation on how to file a support case if you need help

* [**Support Plans and Service Level Agreements available**](support#defect-responses): Description of the multiple levels of support available for purchase

* [**Troubleshooting tips**](/onboarding/enterprise-support#what-to-check-before-logging-an-issue) and [**Information to provide in a support case**](/onboarding/enterprise-support#information-to-provide-when-logging-an-issue): Advice to help your development and support team get to the bottom of issues

### Supported versions 

Clarity on the [supported versions](/support/matrix) of SDKs, Browsers and languages. Architects and developers should use this to ensure your project uses supported languages, libraries and SDKs.

### Feedback portal

You may file [product feedback](https://auth0.com/feedback) suggestions via the above feedback portal or via the support center for better visibility of what you’ve filed over time. Architects and developers can use this site to provide feedback on the Auth0 product for consideration as enhancements in the future.

### Professional Services

Our world-wide [professional services team](/services) is ready to help speed your project to success. Project owners will find this useful for learning how Auth0 identity experts can help accelerate your project or fill in any temporary skill gaps.

## Set up operations

### Pre-launch advice and production check 

Tips and tools to help you plan for your launch are available in our [Prelaunch Advice](/pre-deployment) and [Production Check](/docs/pre-deployment/how-to-run-test). Project managers as well as the development and operations teams should go through these resources to leverage advice for a smooth launch.

### Operational policies 

Familiarize yourself with [policies](/policies) so you know the lead times for operational requests. The policies are useful for an entire team, but project owners and operations teams especially should be aware of Auth0 operational policies.

### Status Dashboard 

Our [Status Dashboard](http://status.auth0.com/) provides status on Auth0 availability and the ability to subscribe to status updates. Although rare, if there is a service interruption, Auth0 conducts a root cause analysis and publishes the results on this site as well. Operations and support teams should be familiar with how to check the Auth0 status.

### Monitoring endpoints for Auth0
