# Enable Role-Based Access Control for APIs

This guide will show you how to enable [role-based access control (RBAC)](/authorization/concepts/rbac) from the Auth0 Dashboard or with the Management API. This effectively enables the API Authorization Core feature set.

## Before you start

Here are some things to know before you begin.

* Any configured [rules](/authorization/concepts/authz-rules) run _after_ RBAC authorization decisions are made, so they may override default behavior.
* Including permissions in the Access Token reduces the amount of requests to retrieve permissions, but increases token size.
* While RBAC is enabled, the Access Token's `scope` claim includes an intersection of the requested permissions and the permissions assigned to the user, regardless of whether permissions are also included in the Access Token.
* When RBAC is disabled, default behavior is observed. An application can request any permission defined for the API, and the `scope` claim will include all requested permissions.

## From the Dashboard

To enable RBAC from the Dashboard:

1. Navigate to the [APIs](${manage_url}/#/apis) page in the [Auth0 Dashboard](${manage_url}/), and click the name of the API to view.

2. Scroll to **RBAC Settings** and enable the **Enable RBAC** toggle.

3. If you want to include all permissions assigned to the user in the `permissions` claim of the Access Token, enable the **Add Permissions in the Access Token** toggle, and click **Save**.

::: note
Including permissions in the Access Token allows you to make minimal calls to retrieve permissions, but increases token size. As long as RBAC is enabled, the `scope` claim of the Access Token includes an intersection of the requested permissions and the permissions assigned to the user, regardless of whether permissions are also included in the Access Token.

When RBAC is disabled, default behavior is observed; an application can request any permission defined for the API, and the `scope` claim will include all requested permissions.

## Using the Management API

To enable RBAC using the Management API, make a `PATCH` request to the [Update Resource Server endpoint](/api/management/v2#!/resource_servers/patch_resource_server). Be sure to replace `API_ID`, `MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `PERMISSION_NAME`, and `PERMISSION_DESC` placeholder values with your API ID, Management API Access Token, permission name(s), and permission description(s), respectively.

```har
{
    "method": "PATCH",
    "url": "https://${account.namespace}/api/v2/resource-servers/API_ID",
  "headers": [
    { "name": "Content-Type", "value": "application/json" },
    { "name": "Authorization", "value": "Bearer MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN" },
    { "name": "Cache-Control", "value": "no-cache" }
    ],
    "postData": {
    "mimeType": "application/json",
    "text" : "{ \"enforce_policies\": \"true\", \"token_dialect\": \"TOKEN_DIALECT\" }"
    }
}
```

| **Value** | **Description** |
| - | - |
| `API_ID` | Î¤he ID of the API for which you want to enable RBAC. |
| `MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN`  | [Access Token for the Management API](/api/management/v2/tokens) with the <dfn data-key="scope">scope</dfn> `update:resource_servers`. |
| `TOKEN_DIALECT` | Dialect of the <dfn data-key="access-token">Access Token</dfn> for the specified API.|

### Token Dialect Options

Available options include:

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
|  `access_token` | In the `scope` claim of the Access Token, includes an intersection of the requested permissions and the permissions assigned to the user. No `permissions` claim is passed. |
| `access_token_authz` | In the `scope` claim of the Access Token, includes an intersection of the requested permissions and the permissions assigned to the user. In the `permissions` claim of the Access Token, includes all permissions assigned to the user. Allows you to make minimal calls to retrieve permissions, but increases token size. |
