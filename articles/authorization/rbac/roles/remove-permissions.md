# Remove Permissions from Roles

In this guide, you'll learn how to remove permissions assigned to roles from the Auth0 Dashboard or with the Management API.

<%= include('../../_includes/_enable-authz-core') %>

## From the Dashboard

To remove permissions assigned to roles on the Dashboard:

1. Navigate to the [Users & Roles > Roles](${manage_url}/#/roles) page in the [Auth0 Dashboard](${manage_url}/), and click the name of the role to view.

## Using the Management API

To remove permissions assigned to roles with the Management API, make a `DELETE` call to the [Delete Role Permissions endpoint](/api/management/v2#!/roles/delete_role_permissions). Be sure to replace `ROLE_ID`, `MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `API_ID`, and `PERMISSION_NAME` placeholder values with your role ID, Management API Access Token, API ID(s), and permission name(s), respectively.

```har
{
	"method": "DELETE",
	"url": "https://${account.namespace}/api/v2/roles/ROLE_ID/permissions",
  "headers": [
    { "name": "Content-Type", "value": "application/json" },
   	{ "name": "Authorization", "value": "Bearer MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN" },
    { "name": "Cache-Control", "value": "no-cache" }
	],
	"postData": {
    "mimeType": "application/json",
    "text": "{ \"permissions\": [ { \"resource_server_identifier\": \"API_ID\", \"permission_name\": \"PERMISSION_NAME\" }, { \"resource_server_identifier\": \"API_ID\", \"permission_name\": \"PERMISSION_NAME\" } ] }"
  }
}
```
