# Delete Roles

In this guide, you'll learn how to delete a role from the Auth0 Dashboard or with the Management API. Roles are used with the API Authorization Core feature set.

## Using the Management API

To delete a role with the Management API, make a `DELETE` request to the [Delete Role endpoint](/api/management/v2#!/roles/delete_role). Be sure to replace `ROLE_ID` and `MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN` placeholder values with your role ID and Management API Access Token, respectively.

```har
{
	"method": "DELETE",
	"url": "https://${account.namespace}/api/v2/roles/ROLE_ID",
	"headers": [
   	{ "name": "Authorization", "value": "Bearer MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN" }
	]
}
```

| **Value** | **Description** |

| `ROLE_ID` | Î¤he ID of the role you want to delete. |
| `MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN`  | [Access Token for the Management API](/api/management/v2/tokens) with the <dfn data-key="scope">scope</dfn> `delete:roles`. |
