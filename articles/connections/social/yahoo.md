# Add Yahoo Login to Your App

This guide will show you how to add functionality to your web app that allows your users to log in with Yahoo.

## 1. Set up your app in Yahoo

To begin, you need a Yahoo User ID. If you donâ€™t have one, you can create one via [login.yahoo.com](https://login.yahoo.com).

Once you have a login, go to [Yahoo Developer Apps](https://developer.yahoo.com/apps/) and click on the **Create an App** button to launch the app-creation screen. You will be asked for the following parameters:

| **Parameter** | **Value** |
| - | - |
| **Application Name** | A friendly-name for your application |
| **Application Type** | `Web Application` |
| **Redirect URI(s)** | `https://${account.namespace}` |

<%= include('../_find-auth0-domain-redirects') %>

For the **API Permissions**, select **Profiles (Social Directory)**. You may select additional API Permissions, but you need the **Profiles (Social Directory)** option at the very least (otherwise, Yahoo doesn't return the user's email address).

For each API Permission that you allow, you can choose the specific subset of permissions available to the app (e.g., read-only, read/write).

When done, click **Create App** to proceed. Once the application is created, Yahoo will show you your **Client ID** (Consumer Key) and **Client Secret** (Consumer Secret). Copy these values, because you will use them to set up the connection in Auth0.

## 2. Create and enable a connection in Auth0

[Set up the Yahoo! social connection](/dashboard/guides/connections/set-up-connections-social) in Auth0. Make sure you have the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** generated in Step 1.

## 3. Test the connection

You're ready to [test your connection](/dashboard/guides/connections/test-connections-social).
