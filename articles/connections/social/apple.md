# Add Native Sign In with Apple to Your App

Apple requires the adoption of native Sign In with Apple (SIWA) capabilities if you have an app published on the App Store and you support different third-party sign-in options (such as Facebook, Google, or Twitter). 

## How it works

Support for native Sign In with Apple is built on top of the [OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-token-exchange-16). Auth0 created a profile for native SIWA to handle the following flow:

1. User authenticates via the Apple SDK on their iPhone/iPad. They receive an authorization code.
2. The application calls Auth0's `/oauth/token` endpoint with the following parameters:
    - `subject_token`: the authorization code they received above
    - `subject_token_type`: `http://auth0.com/oauth/token-type/apple-authz-code`
    - `grant_type`: `urn:ietf:params:oath:grant-type:token-exchange`
    - `client_id`: their Auth0 Client ID
    - `audience` and `scope` as needed (optional)
3. Auth0 exchanges the `code` with Apple for a set of ID, access, and refresh tokens.
4. Auth0 saves the user profile. Executes rules and authorization, then issues access tokens (refresh tokens and ID tokens) as requested. These tokens can now be used to protect your APIs and users are managed in Auth0.

To add support for native SIWA, you'll need to have an Apple Developer account, an Auth0 tenant set up with a custom domain, and a web application configured to use Auth0 for authentication at that domain. Make sure you have those properly configured before proceeding.

* An [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) account, which is a paid account with Apple. (There is no free trial available unless you are part of their [iOS Developer University Program](https://developer.apple.com/support/compare-memberships/)).
* A domain (i.e., `<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>.com`) that you can use and point to your web app and an internet-accessible server where you will run the app, and that responds on behalf of this domain. You will also need to configure this server with a TLS certificate (Apple won't accept unsecured HTTP connections) and [`npm` and `Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (so you can run the web application). Lastly, to use the Email Relay Service, you will need to configure your domain with Sender Policy Framework (SPF) DNS TXT records. See [Sign In with Apple Get Started](https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/get-started/) for more information.
* A [Custom Domain](/custom-domains) set up on your Auth0 tenant for domain verification with Apple.

::: panel Before you Begin: Test the Connection with Auth0 Developer Credentials 
You can test the Apple connection:

1. On the [Dashboard](${manage_url}), go to **Connections > Social**.
2. Click on the Apple connection.
3. Leave the **Settings** tab fields blank. 

    ![Apple Settings](/media/articles/connections/social/apple/apple-connection.png)

4. On the **Applications** tab, select the applications you want to test the connection with and click **Save**.
5. Back on the **Settings** tab, click **Try**.

    This displays the Apple sign in page. This tests the connection using Auth0â€™s developer credentials. **Prior to using it in production applications**, you need to set up your own developer credentials following the instructions below.
:::

## Configure your app in your Apple Developer Account

Once your Developer Account is set up, you can follow the instructions in the [Apple Setup Guide](/connections/apple-setup) to get your app set up. If you have any issues, refer to the [Apple Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/get-started/).

When setting up your application, make sure you save the following items for the Apple connection settings in the Dashboard:

* Client ID (the Service ID)
* Client Secret Signing Key
* Apple Team ID
* Client Signing Key ID (optional)

1. When you sign into the developer account, go to the [Certificates, IDs, & Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list) section, and choose the [Identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/serviceId) subsection on the left menu.

2. Click **Register an App ID** button.

3. Choose **App IDs** as the identifier type, and click **Continue**. 

4. Enter a description for your new App ID and a Bundle ID. For the latter, Apple recommends using a reverse-domain name style string (e.g., `com.<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>.appid`). 

5. Scroll down and check the **Sign In with Apple** feature. You won't have to use the **Edit** here. You will configure this feature later.

6. Leave the other options with their default values and click **Continue**. When you click on this button, Apple  displays a summary of the options you just configured. If everything is correct, click **Register**. Apple redirects you to the **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles** subsection again, this time listing your new App ID. 

7. Create a Service ID that represents your application. This might look like a redundant effort, but Apple organizes it so you can nest multiple Services IDs under the same App ID. This makes sense when you have distinct versions of your application to support different devices.

8. Click the round, blue icon next to the **Identifiers** header, then choose **Services IDs** and click  **Continue**. 

9. Fill in the same fields as in step 4 above (description and identifier), and enable the **Sign In with Apple** feature. 

10. Click **Configure**. Apple displays a dialog where you define the web domain you will use (`<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>.com`) and add a **Return URL** (`https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`). Click **Save**.  

11. On the **Register a Services ID** page, click **Continue** and, on the next screen, click **Register**.

    After registering your Service ID, Apple redirects you to the **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles** page. There, you will see your newly-created Service ID.
  
12. Click the Service ID and view the details of the service. Click **Configure** next to the **Sign In with Apple** feature. 

    This time, Apple displays two new buttons next to your domain: **Download** and **Verify**.

13. Click **Download** for Apple to send you a file called `apple-developer-domain-association.txt`. You will have to use the contents of this file soon. Also, keep the page open because you will have to use the **Verify** button later.

## Create your web application

1. After configuring the Apple developer account, complete the web application code. Create an `npm` project and install a few dependencies:

    ``` text
    # start the npm project
    npm init -y

    # install its dependencies
    npm i dotenv \
      express \
      express-session \
      jsonwebtoken \
      passport \
      passport-oauth
    ``` 

    | Package | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | **dotenv** | Environment variables that are better kept out of the code itself. |
    | **express** | Make your project an Express web app. |
    | **express-session** | Passport will need this package to manage users' sessions. |
    | **jsonwebtoken** | Generate a JWT to work as the client secret while configuring passport. |
    | **passport** | Use this package to handle user authentication in your app. |
    | **passport-oauth** | Use this passport strategy to integrate with Apple's identity provider. |

2. After installing these packages, create a new file called `app.js` and insert the following code into it:

    ``` js
    const express = require("express");
    const session = require("express-session");
    const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
    const passport = require("passport");
    const OAuth2Strategy = require("passport-oauth").OAuth2Strategy;
    const fs = require("fs");
    const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");

    const domainAssociation = fs.readFileSync(
      "./apple-developer-domain-association.txt",
      "utf8"
    );
    const appleStrategy = "apple";

    const app = express();

    app.use(
      session({
        secret: "secret",
        saveUninitialized: false,
        resave: false
      })
    );

    app.use(passport.initialize());
    app.use(passport.session());

    passport.use(
      "apple",
      new OAuth2Strategy(
        {
          authorizationURL: "https://appleid.apple.com/auth/authorize",
          tokenURL: "https://appleid.apple.com/auth/token",
          clientID: process.env.CLIENT_ID,
          clientSecret: process.env.CLIENT_SECRET,
          callbackURL: process.env.CALLBACK,
          state: Date.now() // bleh
        },
        (accessToken, refreshToken, payload, profile, done) => {
      done(null, { profile, payload });
        }
      )
    );

    passport.serializeUser((user, done) => {
      done(null, user);
    });

    passport.deserializeUser((user, done) => {
      done(null, user);
    });

    app.get("/.well-known/apple-developer-domain-association.txt", (req, res) => {
      res.send(domainAssociation);
    });

    app.get("/auth/apple", passport.authenticate(appleStrategy));

    app.get(
      "/callback",
      passport.authenticate(appleStrategy, {
        successRedirect: "/",
        failureRedirect: "/login"
      })
    );

    app.get("/profile", (req, res) => {
      res.send(
        jwt.decode(req.session.passport.user.payload.id_token, { complete: true })
      );
    });

    app.get("/", (req, res) => {
      console.log("User", req.user);
      res.send(JSON.stringify({ Hello: "World" }));
    });

    app.listen(port, () => {
      console.log("Apple Login POC listening on port " + port + "!");
    });
    ```

    In the code above, you will notice that there is a reference to the `apple-developer-domain-association.txt` file. Make this file available to the app while running it in your server so Apple can check that you are the owner of the domain you used in the previous section. Move the file you downloaded from Apple to the project root.

3. To confirm that the code is working, execute the following commands locally.

    ``` text
    export CLIENT_ID=test
    export CLIENT_SECRET=test
    export CALLBACK=test

    npm start
    ```

::: note
You can leave the test values on the environment variables for the moment. You will configure these variables later.
:::

If everything works as expected, you will see the contents of the domain association file at the following link: `http://localhost:3000/.well-known/apple-developer-domain-association.txt`. If that is the case, you are ready to make your application run on the internet-accessible server.

### Verify domain ownership on Apple

1. Move your project code to your server and make it run like you did locally (i.e., you still don't need to provide the final environment variables). To achieve that, you can use whatever means you prefer. For example, you can use Git, or you can move the files manually (with the help of `scp` or similar). 

2. After running this project on an internet-accessible server (which must respond on behalf of the domain you configured in the Apple developer account), go back to the page you left open (**Register a Services ID**), and click **Verify**. If you got everything right, Apple will confirm that you own the informed domain.

### Configure email relay service

1. To use the email relay service that Apple provides, click **More** under the **Certificates, Identifiers, & Profiles** section and click **Configure**. 

2. Add your domain (`<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>.com`) in the field available on **Domains and Associated Email Addresses** 

3. Click **Register**. 

4. Add an email address (for example, `me@<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>.com`) in **Individual Email Addresses** and click  **Register**.

## Generate client secret

Now that you have verified your domain with Apple, define the environment variables needed to use this identity provider. 

1. Configure the following variables:

    | Variable | Description
    | --- | --- |
    | **CLIENT_ID** | Gets the value that you used as the identifier of the Service ID you created at Apple  (`com.<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>.webapp`). |
    | **CALLBACK** | The URL to which the user will be redirected after the authentication process takes place. You will have to use the value you passed to the **Return URL** field (`<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>.com/callback`) on the same Service ID. |

2. For most OAuth-compliant identity providers, the `CLIENT_SECRET` variable is static. However, Apple rotates this secret by using signed JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) that carry the `exp` claim. To generate this key, go to **Keys** in **Certificates, Identifiers, & Profiles** section in your Apple developer dashboard. 

3. Click the round, blue icon to add a new key. 

4. Use **Sign In with Apple Key** to fill the **Key Name** field, and check the **Sign In with Apple** option. 

5. Click **Configure** to confirm that the **Choose a Primary App ID** field is filled with your App ID. 

6. Click **Save**, then **Continue**, then **Register** (3 buttons on 3 pages).

  Apple redirects you to a page where you will be able to download the new key. 
  
7. Click the download button and then move the file to your project root. Rename it to `authkey.p8`. 

8. Back in the Apple Developer Portal, make a note of the Key ID click **Done**.

9. Create a new file called `generate-secret.js` inside the project root, and add the following code to it:

    ``` js
    const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");
    const fs = require("fs");

    const privateKey = fs.readFileSync("./authkey.p8");
    const token = jwt.sign({}, privateKey, {
      algorithm: "ES256",
      expiresIn: "2 days",
      audience: "https://appleid.apple.com",
      issuer: "TEAM_ID",
      subject: "com.<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>.webapp",
      keyid: "KEY_ID"
    });

    console.log("The token is:", token);
    ```

    Replace `com.<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>.webapp` with the identifier for your Service ID and `TEAM_ID` with your Team ID. To find this value, visit this [page](https://developer.apple.com/account/#/membership). You'll also need to replace `KEY_ID` with the Key ID you noted earlier.

10. Run this script to generate a new token:

    ``` text
    node generate-secret.js
    ```

    The value that the script outputs is the value that you will use on the `CLIENT_SECRET` environment variable. 

11. Return to your Auth0 dashboard and make sure your custom social connection fields look like this:

    | Field | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Name | Apple, or any name you choose |
    | Client ID | Your Services ID identifier, (e.g., `com.<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>.webapp`) |
    | Client Secret | The string generated in the previous step |
    | Fetch User Profile Script | Check the variables in the script to make sure they are correct |
    | Authorization URL | `https://appleid.apple.com/auth/authorize` |
    | Token URL | `https://appleid.apple.com/auth/token` |
    | Scope | email name |
    | Custom Headers | `"UserAgent": "Auth0", "Accepts": "application/json"`|

12. Click **Save** and enable this connection for your application.

13. On your server, stop the web app instance that is running, and issue the following commands:

    ``` text
    # now you need to use the real values
    export CLIENT_ID=com.<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>.webapp
    export CLIENT_SECRET=eyJ...KsA
    export CALLBACK=https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>.com/callback

    npm start
    ```

    This time, set the environment variables with the final values. If things work as expected, you will see the application running under your domain again. Then, if you request for the `/auth/.apple` route under this domain, your application will redirect you to the **Sign In with Apple** page so you can log into your application. On this page, if you use valid credentials, Apple will sign you into the application (after the multifactor authentication process).

## Configure the connection in Auth0

1. Once you have the credentials you need from your Apple developer account, Go to [**Connections** > **Social**](${manage_url}), and click on the **Apple** connection.

2. On the **Settings** tab, complete the fields **Client ID** (Services ID), **Client Secret Signing Key**, and **Apple Team ID**. You can also fill in the **Key ID** but it is optional, as Apple will accept the key without the ID.

3. Click **Save**.

## Test the connection

::: note
If you are using the Classic Universal Login flow, or embedding `Lock.js` in your application, make sure you are using `Lock.js` version 11.16 or later.
:::

1. Visit your application login page and you should see an option for Sign In with Apple:

    ![Apple Login Page](/media/articles/connections/social/apple/apple-login-page.png)

2. Click **Continue with Apple**, then enter your Apple ID and password.

3. You will be asked to verify a new device. Click **Allow**.

4. Next you'll be given a verication code. Make a note of this code, click **Done**, and then enter the code on the **Two-Factor Authentication** screen.

    ![Apple Two-Factor Authentication](/media/articles/connections/social/apple/apple-2FA.png)

5. When this is done, you'll have the option to edit your name and choose whether you'd like to share or hide your email. Make your choice, then click **Continue**.

    ![Apple Email Preferences](/media/articles/connections/social/apple/apple-email-preferences.png)

    You are now signed in to your application with Apple!
