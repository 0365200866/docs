# Connect Apps to PayPal Sandbox

In addition to its production system, PayPal offers sandboxes, so you can isolate customization and development work from your production environment until youâ€™re ready to deploy changes. This guide will show you how to add functionality to your web app that allows your users to log in with PayPal Sandbox.

To learn more about PayPal Sandboxes, see the [PayPal Sandbox Testing Guide](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api-basics/sandbox/).

## Prerequisites

Before connecting your Auth0 app to PayPal Sandbox, you must have already [signed up for and configured your account with PayPal](https://developer.paypal.com). Upon account creation, you will have access to a PayPal Sandbox.

## Steps

To connect your app to PayPal Sandbox, you will:

1. [Set up your app in PayPal Sandbox](#set-up-your-app-in-paypal)
2. [Create and enable a connection in Auth0](#create-and-enable-a-connection-in-auth0)
3. [Test the connection](#test-the-connection)

### Set up your app in PayPal Sandbox

Create an app in PayPal Sandbox and generate credentials for it, using [PayPal's Get Credentials](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/overview/#get-credentials) doc. During this process, PayPal will generate a **Client ID** and **Secret** for your application; make note of these.

While setting up your app, make sure you use the following settings:

| Field | Value to Provide |
| - | - |
| Return URL | `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback` |
| Log In with PayPal | Enable, then under **Advanced Options**, select **Full Name**, **Date of Birth**, **Timezone**, **Locale**, and **Language**. |

<%= include('../../connections/_find-auth0-domain-redirects') %>

### Create and enable a connection in Auth0

[Set up the PayPal Sandbox social connection](/dashboard/guides/connections/set-up-connections-social) in Auth0. Make sure you have the **Client ID** and the **Secret** generated in Step 1; enter them into the **App ID** and **App Secret** fields, respectively.

### Test the connection

You're ready to [test your connection](/dashboard/guides/connections/test-connections-social). After logging in, you'll be prompted to allow your app access. To do so, click **Install unlisted app**.

::: note
Your app's **Return URL** can take up to 3 hours to go into effect with Paypal, which can cause the connection to fail until it is updated.
