# Add Sign In with Apple to Web or Other Apps

When setting up your application with your Apple Developer account, make sure you save the following IDs and keys for the application connection settings in the Auth0 Dashboard:

* Client ID (the Service ID)
* App ID

## Prerequisites

Before you configure Sign In with Apple for your native app in Auth0, do the following:

* Have an [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) account, which is a paid account with Apple. (There is no free trial available unless you are part of their [iOS Developer University Program](https://developer.apple.com/support/compare-memberships/)).

* [Set Up Apps in the Apple Developer Portal](/connections/apple-siwa/guides/set-up-apple)

See the [Web Application Example](#web-application-configuration-example) for details on how to configure your web application to work with Sign In with Apple in Auth0. 

## Configure and test the connection in Auth0

Once you have the credentials you need from your Apple Developer account, you need to configure the application client and the connection settings in Auth0.

1. On the Auth0 Dashboard, go to **Applications**. Click the gear to open the settings for your app. 

2. At the bottom of the page, click **Show Advanced Settings** and go to the **Mobile Settings** tab. Under **Native Social Login**. enable the **Enable Sign In with Apple** toggle.

3. Go to **Connections** > **Social**, and click on the **Apple** connection.

4. On the **Settings** tab, complete the fields **Client ID** (Services ID), **Client Secret Signing Key**, and **Apple Team ID**. You can also fill in the **Key ID** but it is optional, as Apple will accept the key without the ID.

5. Click **Save**.

6. [Test the connection](/connections/social/apple/guides/test-siwa-connection).

## Web application configuration example

1. Create an `npm` project and install a few dependencies:

    ``` text
    # start the npm project
    npm init -y

    # install its dependencies
    npm i dotenv \
      express \
      express-session \
      jsonwebtoken \
      passport \
      passport-oauth
    ``` 

    | Package | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | **dotenv** | Environment variables that are better kept out of the code itself. |
    | **express** | Make your project an Express web app. |
    | **express-session** | Passport will need this package to manage users' sessions. |
    | **jsonwebtoken** | Generate a JWT to work as the client secret while configuring passport. |
    | **passport** | Use this package to handle user authentication in your app. |
    | **passport-oauth** | Use this passport strategy to integrate with Apple's identity provider. |

2. After installing these packages, create a new file called `app.js` and insert the following code into it:

    ``` js
    const express = require("express");
    const session = require("express-session");
    const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
    const passport = require("passport");
    const OAuth2Strategy = require("passport-oauth").OAuth2Strategy;
    const fs = require("fs");
    const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");

    const domainAssociation = fs.readFileSync(
      "./apple-developer-domain-association.txt",
      "utf8"
    );
    const appleStrategy = "apple";

    const app = express();

    app.use(
      session({
        secret: "secret",
        saveUninitialized: false,
        resave: false
      })
    );

    app.use(passport.initialize());
    app.use(passport.session());

    passport.use(
      "apple",
      new OAuth2Strategy(
        {
          authorizationURL: "https://appleid.apple.com/auth/authorize",
          tokenURL: "https://appleid.apple.com/auth/token",
          clientID: process.env.CLIENT_ID,
          clientSecret: process.env.CLIENT_SECRET,
          callbackURL: process.env.CALLBACK,
          state: Date.now() // bleh
        },
        (accessToken, refreshToken, payload, profile, done) => {
      done(null, { profile, payload });
        }
      )
    );

    passport.serializeUser((user, done) => {
      done(null, user);
    });

    passport.deserializeUser((user, done) => {
      done(null, user);
    });

    app.get("/.well-known/apple-developer-domain-association.txt", (req, res) => {
      res.send(domainAssociation);
    });

    app.get("/auth/apple", passport.authenticate(appleStrategy));

    app.get(
      "/callback",
      passport.authenticate(appleStrategy, {
        successRedirect: "/",
        failureRedirect: "/login"
      })
    );

    app.get("/profile", (req, res) => {
      res.send(
        jwt.decode(req.session.passport.user.payload.id_token, { complete: true })
      );
    });

    app.get("/", (req, res) => {
      console.log("User", req.user);
      res.send(JSON.stringify({ Hello: "World" }));
    });

    app.listen(port, () => {
      console.log("Apple Login POC listening on port " + port + "!");
    });
    ```

    In the code above, you will notice that there is a reference to the `apple-developer-domain-association.txt` file. Make this file available to the app while running it in your server so Apple can check that you are the owner of the domain you used in the previous section. Move the file you downloaded from Apple to the project root.

3. To confirm that the code is working, execute the following commands locally.

    ``` text
    export CLIENT_ID=test
    export CLIENT_SECRET=test
    export CALLBACK=test

    npm start
    ```

::: note
You can leave the test values on the environment variables for the moment. You will configure these variables later.
:::

If everything works as expected, you will see the contents of the domain association file at the following link: `http://localhost:3000/.well-known/apple-developer-domain-association.txt`. If that is the case, you are ready to make your application run on the internet-accessible server.

### Verify domain ownership on the Apple Developer portal

1. Move your project code to your server and make it run like you did locally. You still don't need to provide the final environment variables. To achieve that, you can use whatever means you prefer. For example, you can use Git, or you can move the files manually (with the help of `scp` or similar). 

2. After running this project on an internet-accessible server (which must respond on behalf of the domain you configured in the Apple developer account), go back to the page you left open on the Apple Developer portal (**Register a Services ID**), and click **Verify**. If you got everything right, Apple will confirm that you own the informed domain.

### Configure email relay service

1. To use the email relay service that Apple provides, click **More** under the **Certificates, Identifiers, & Profiles** section and click **Configure**. 

2. Add your domain (`<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>.com`) in the field available on **Domains and Associated Email Addresses** 

3. Click **Register**. 

4. Add an email address (for example, `me@<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>.com`) in **Individual Email Addresses** and click  **Register**.

### Configure client variables

Now that you have verified your domain with Apple, define the environment variables needed to use this identity provider. 

For most OAuth-compliant identity providers, the `CLIENT_SECRET` variable is static. However, Apple rotates this secret by using signed JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) that carry the `exp` claim. To generate this key, go to **Keys** in **Certificates, Identifiers, & Profiles** section in your Apple Developer portal and configure the following variables: 

* **CLIENT_ID**: Gets the value that you used as the identifier of the Service ID you created at Apple  (`com.<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>.webapp`). 
* **CALLBACK**: The URL to which the user will be redirected after the authentication process takes place. You will have to use the value you passed to the **Return URL** field (`<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>.com/callback`) on the same Service ID.
