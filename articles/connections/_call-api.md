Once a user successfully authenticates, ${idp} will include an <dfn data-key="access-token">Access Token</dfn> in the user profile it returns to Auth0. You can use this token to call ${idp}'s API.

To get the ${idp} Access Token, you must retrieve the full user's profile using the Auth0 Management API and extract the Access Token from the response. For detailed steps, see [Call an Identity Provider's API](/connections/calling-an-external-idp-api).
