The first step in a successful implementation is architecting your Identity and Access Management solution. We work together with your product and engineering teams to **architect an Identity solution** for your environment and build an **incremental Go-Live plan** that solves the most-pressing identity problems early. Auth0 Professional Services help your project reach success quickly and address your business objectives in a pragmatic, stepwise manner. 

PS Solutions Architects have decades of combined industry expertise and Auth0-specific training. We have delivered **thousands of successful IAM projects and integrations**. Let us help you steer clear of costly security pitfalls and build a solid foundation for your identity needs, while reducing risk.

### Get to production faster

We can consolidate all the enablement activities leading to a successful adoption into three major milestones or phases:

1. Solution discovery and architecture 
2. Initial Go-Live 
3. Advanced Go-Live

In the discovery phase, our Solution Architects will work with your teams to identify the core goals, features, and functionality that constitute your successful IAM implementation. We will also uncover any legacy architectural issues or requirements that may need more careful consideration.

The initial Go-Live milestone is designed to be impactful enough to make material differences in the overall Identity project. At the same time, it is limited enough that it can be reached quickly&mdash;ideally within 30 days of the project start&mdash;to keep the positive momentum. The initial Go-Live typically includes migration off a legacy IDP, must-have features, and possibly a subset of all applications.

The last milestone, Advanced Go-Live, can be broken into multiple sub-milestones, especially if you have multiple applications or development teams. This helps manage the complexity of a large project and achieves incremental and steady progress. 

The goal of a Professional Services engagement is to identify, document, and build consensus with you on these milestones as the path to successful Auth0 adoption. 

If any part of your project requires more specialized attention and implementation assistance from an Auth0 Solution Architect, we may position additional Professional Services to help you reach that milestone.
