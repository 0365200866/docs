# Discover

Discovery is at the heart of what we do: if you've never engaged with Professional Services on a project before then Discovery is where we start. Discovery is specifically designed to help us - and you - understand what's required for sucessfull integration with Auth0. Conducted as a series of [Architectural Discovery](/services/architect-and-design#architectural-discovery) and [Scenario Guidance](/services/architect-and-design#scenario-guidance) sessions, we typically work with you and your team(s), on-site, to identify critical use case scenario(s) and build solution design(s). Why Discovery? Identifying your primary objectives early on will help you and your team(s) focus on the specifics important to building out your solution. Captured in a bespoke [Discovery Report](#discovery-report), and backed by beskoke Planning Guidance, we'll help you understand what you need to consider to bring your project(s) to market in the most effective manner.

Your Discovery Report provides you with bespoke and tailored guidance. The report is designed to be a living document: it will grow, be refined, and acts as a collaborative tool to provide project specifc best practice as well as the base line reference for your Auth0 integration - whether part of a Professional Services engagement or beyond. The Discovery Report also provides recommendations for immediate review, as well as providing you with at-a-glance reference to general purpose Auth0 [Business to Consumer (B2C)](/architecture-scenarios/b2c) and [Business to Business (B2B)](/architecture-scenarios/b2b) Identity and Access Management guidance - as and when you need it.
