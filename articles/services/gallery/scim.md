# System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)

SCIM - the System for Cross-domain Identity Management - is a standardized protocol and schema for provisioning, deprovisioning, and managing user identity-related information across systems. If you are developing a cloud application or service that is intended to be used by one or more enterprise organizations, SCIM provides a standardized way for these organizations to programmatically provision, deprovision, and manage their user account records in your application. 

Customized extensibility provided by the Auth0 Professional Services team allows you to quickly protoype and deploy to production SCIM 2.0-based user provisioning, deprovisioning, and management for any application using Auth0 as its user identity front end. We achieve this by implementing a customized SCIM 2.0 server that translates all SCIM messages into the format required by your identity API.
