# Verified Email Address Change

A self-service facility typically provides users with the capability to change one or more aspects of their user profile. Commonly referred to as _MyAccount_ or _MyProfile_ functionality, this often includes the ability for a user to change his/her email address - for cases where an existing email address is no longer valid or a different email address is preferred. Self-service email address change without the proper controls however, can lead to various account management issues, and/or expose security vulnerabilities which can be exploited. Verified Email Address Change workflow is provided by Auth0 Professional Services as a customized extensibility solution, that leverages Auth0 functionality to address the sort of problems that can occur in unverified email address change scenarios.
