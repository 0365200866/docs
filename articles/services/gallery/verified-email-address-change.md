# Verified Email Address Change

A self-service facility typically provides users with the capability to change one or more aspects of their user profile. Commonly referred to as _MyAccount_ or _MyProfile_ functionality, this often includes the ability for a user to change his/her email address, in cases where an existing email address is no longer valid or preferred. Self-service email address change without the proper controls however can lead to various account management issues, and/or expose security vulnerabilities which can be exploited. Verified Email Address Change workflow is provided by Auth0 Professional Services as a customized extensibility solution, which leverages Auth0 functionality to address the problems that can occur in unverified email address change scenarios.
