# Maintain and Improve

Once implementation is complete, we'll work with your teams to review your Identity environment, optimize and improve your solution, advise on new features, and answer any questions; services designed to help you maintain and improve on your Auth0 investment. 

To help support this effort, we recommend scheduling an annual HealthCheck engagement with Professional Services. For our larger customers, we also provide our post-implementation consulting service: Auth0’s “Premier Success” offering assigns a dedicated Solutions Architect to meet with your team on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis to help maintain and improve your Auth0 solution.
