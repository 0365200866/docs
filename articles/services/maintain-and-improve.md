## Maintain and improve your IAM solution

Once the implementation is complete, we will work with your teams to review your Identity environment, optimize and improve your solution, introduce new features, and answer any questions. To support this effort, we recommend scheduling an annual HealthCheck engagement.  

For our larger customers, we also provide our post-implementation consulting service. Auth0’s “Premier Success” offering assigns a dedicated Solutions Architect to meet with your team on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis to help maintain and improve your Auth0 solution. 
 
_We provide continuous education and knowledge transfer throughout the engagement._
