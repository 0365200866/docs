Auth0 is a unique service that offers developers unrivaled flexibility and extensibility. Our expert Professional Services team knows how to extend Auth0 in the ways that are most optimal for the platform and for your environment.

In addition to enablement activities, Professional Services provides **custom implementation services**.

Solutions that Professional Services can deliver to help you achieve the product functionality, service connectivity, operational readiness, and/or quality assurance you require to get to production include: 

* **Custom rules, hooks, DB scripts, login pages, and email templates:** Solve a user experience, 3rd-party service integration, or other logical problem within a customer’s Auth0 authentication and authorization workflow. These customizations happen in-product and do not require additional infrastructure to deploy.

* **Custom endpoints and libraries:** Solve a service communication, user experience, or tenant management problem through the use of a custom web services endpoint or code library. Typically deployed on customer or third-party infrastructure.

* **Custom utilities:** Solve a quality assurance or operations problem that is out-of-band from extending core product functionality, such as performance testing or deployment scripts.

* **Custom code samples:** Demonstrate how a developer integrates with Auth0 using a specific language or technology stack. Used primarily for education.

### Maintain and improve your IAM solution

Once the implementation is complete, we will work with your teams to review your Identity environment, optimize and improve your solution, introduce new features, and answer any questions. To support this effort, we recommend scheduling an annual HealthCheck engagement.  

For our larger customers, we also provide our post-implementation consulting service. Auth0’s “Premier Success” offering assigns a dedicated Solutions Architect to meet with your team on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis to help maintain and improve your Auth0 solution. 
 
_We provide continuous education and knowledge transfer throughout the engagement._
