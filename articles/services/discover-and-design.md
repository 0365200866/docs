# Discover & Design

The first stage in a successful implementation involves discovering, designing, and architecting your Identity and Access Management solution, and our Discover & Design services are here to help. We work together with your product and engineering teams to **architect an Identity solution** for your environment and build an **incremental Go-Live plan** that solves the most-pressing identity problems early. Auth0 Professional Services help your projects quickly reach success by addressing your business objectives in a pragmatic, step-by-step manner.

## Architectural Discovery

Focused on discovering the optimum design based on your requirements, Architectural Discovery services provide best practice guidance on topics such as requirements determination, Auth0 Tenant deployment strategies, your use cases, and integration with the software development process in your organization. Engaging with Auth0 Professional Services will help to provide you with a clear understanding of what you need to tackle, and when, in order to fulfill your particular needs. Delivered as part of our [Discover, Design, & Implement packages](/services/packages#discover-design-and-implement-packages).

## Scenario Guidance

Guiding you through your use case scenarios, our Scenario Guidance services help you navigate the possible paths through your discovered use cases in a best practice manner. Covering topics such as OpenID Connect (OIDC) flows, Authorization server capabilities, session management, and Single Sign-On (SSO), engagement with the Auth0 Professional Services team provides visibility into the things you need to prepare you to address what's required. Delivered as part of our [Discover, Design, & Implement packages](/services/packages#discover-design-and-implement-packages).

## Discovery

Discovery is at the heart of what we do: if you've never engaged with Professional Services on a project before then Discovery is where we start. Discovery is a fixed scope service, specifically designed to help us - and you - understand what's required for sucessfull integration with Auth0. Conducted as a series of [Architectural Discovery](#architectural-discovery) and [Scenario Guidance](#scenario-guidance) sessions, we work with you and your team(s) on-site to identify critical use case scenario(s) and build solution design(s). Why Discovery? Identifying your primary objectives early on will help you and your team(s) focus on the specifics important to building out your solution. Captured in a bespoke [Discovery Report](#discovery-report), and backed by beskoke Planning Guidance, we'll help you understand what you need to consider to bring your project(s) to market in the most effective manner.

Your Discovery Report provides you with bespoke and tailored guidance. Each Discovery Report acts as a living document to provide project specifc guidance, as well as base line reference, for your Auth0 integration - whether part of a Professional Services engagement or beyond. The Discovery Report also provides recommendations for immediate review, as well as providing you with at-a-glance reference to general purpose Auth0 Business to Consumer (B2C) and Business to Business (B2B) Identity and Access Management guidance, as and when you need it.
