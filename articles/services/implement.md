## Custom Implementation

In addition, our Custom Implementation services provide a wide range of customized implementation to help you excelerate your integration with Auth0. Again, delivered as part of a number of our [Discover, Design & Implement packages](/services/packages#discover-design-and-implement-packages), Custom Implementation gives you the opertunity to leverage our implementation services in cases where you need more than the standard out-of-box functionality: 

* **Custom rules, hooks, DB scripts, login pages, and email templates:** to solve user experience, 3rd-party service integration, or other logical problem within a customer’s Auth0 authentication and authorization workflow. These customizations happen in-product and do not require additional infrastructure to deploy.

* **Custom APIs and libraries:** to solve service communication, user experience, or tenant management problem through the use of a custom web services endpoint or code library. Typically deployed on customer or third-party infrastructure.

* **Custom utilities:** to solve quality assurance or operations problems that are out-of-band from extending core product functionality, such as performance testing or deployment scripts.
