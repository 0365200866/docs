## Programming Advisory

Focused on accelerating your development team’s understanding of Auth0 SDKs, APIs, extensibility and integration points, our Programming Advisory services give you the oppertunity to engage with our team to get best practice guidance on a wide range of topics. Delivered as part of a number of our Discover & Design packages, Programming Advisory will help you to integrate with Auth0 faster and more effectively, whatever your chosen technology stack.   

## Custom Implementation

In addition, our Custom Implementation services provide a wide range of customized implementation to help you excelerate your integration with Auth0. Again, delivered as part of one of our Discover & Design packages, Custom Implementation gives you the opeertunity to leverage our implementation services in cases where you need more than the standard out-of-box functionality: 

* **Custom rules, hooks, DB scripts, login pages, and email templates:** Solve a user experience, 3rd-party service integration, or other logical problem within a customer’s Auth0 authentication and authorization workflow. These customizations happen in-product and do not require additional infrastructure to deploy.

* **Custom endpoints and libraries:** Solve a service communication, user experience, or tenant management problem through the use of a custom web services endpoint or code library. Typically deployed on customer or third-party infrastructure.

* **Custom utilities:** Solve a quality assurance or operations problem that is out-of-band from extending core product functionality, such as performance testing or deployment scripts.

* **Custom code samples:** Demonstrate how a developer integrates with Auth0 using a specific language or technology stack. Used primarily for education.
