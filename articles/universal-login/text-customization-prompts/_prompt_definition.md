The term `prompt` is used to refer to a specific step in the login flow. Each `prompt` can have one or more screens. For example, the [Login](/universal-login/text-customization-prompts/login) prompt has a single screen, but the [Reset Password](/universal-login/text-customization-prompts/reset-password) prompt has many screens.

Below is the list of available prompts, and you can find all the screens for each one by following the links:
