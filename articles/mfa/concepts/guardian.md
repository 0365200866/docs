# Auth0 Guardian

Auth0 multi-factor authentication (MFA) is available as five factors:

* One-time password
* SMS
* Push
* Duo
* Email

Auth0 Guardian is a service that provides both push notification generation and an application for allowing or denying requests. push sends notification to a userâ€™s pre-registered device - typically a mobile or tablet - from which a user can immediately allow or deny account access via the press of a button.

The push factor is offered with the Guardian mobile app, available for both iOS and Android. In addition, the technology is also available as [whitelabelled Guardian SDK](https://auth0.com/blog/announcing-guardian-whitelabel-sdk) which can be used in custom mobile applications to act as second factor push responder. 

Auth0 Guardian is available on ([Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.auth0.guardian) and the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/auth0-guardian/id1093447833?mt=8)).

The Guardian functionality relies on vendor-specific push notification services which you need to configure. 

::: note
See the documentation for [Apple Push Notification service (APNs)](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/APNSOverview.html) for details on setting up APNs.

## How it works

Instead of integrating with each vendor-specific push notification service, Auth0 push notification is implemented using AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS) which handles the vendor specific integration.

## Guardian and push notifications

When enabling push, end-users will need to have Auth0 Guardian or a custom application built with the Guardian SDK installed in their device. The app is sent push notifications when the user attempts to authenticate, and the user must respond to it in order to login, ensuring that they not only know their login information but also possess the device set up for MFA.

End users will be prompted to download Auth0 Guardian when trying to sign up or log in to your application. Once they indicate that they have successfully downloaded the app, a QR code will appear on screen. They will have a short amount of time in which to scan the code with the designated app. Once this is done, they should see a confirmation screen.

Once this is all set up, when the user attempts to authenticate as normal, their device will receive a push notification via the app, and once they approve the request, they will be logged in.

## Guardian and One-Time Passwords

Upon signup, they can scan a code and set up the app, upon which it will begin generating one-time codes. 

Afterwards, when logging in to the app, the user can simply check the authenticator app for the current one-time code:

And enter the code at the prompt:

Your users will need to have an OTP Authenticator app installed in their mobile devices.

## Guardian SDKs

You can use the [Guardian SDKs](/mfa/guides/guardian/guardian-sdk), available for [iOS](/mfa/guides/guardian/configure-guardian-ios) and [Android](/mfa/guides/guardian/configure-guardian-android) to build your own whitelabel multi-factor authentication application with complete control over the branding and look-and-feel.

With the Guardian SDK, you can build your own custom mobile applications that works like Guardian or integrate some Guardian functionalities, such as receiving push notifications in your existing mobile applications.

A typical scenario could be for a banking app. You can use the Guardian SDK in your existing mobile app to receive and confirm push notifications when someone performs an ATM transaction.

See [auth0-guardian.js](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-guardian.js) for more information.
