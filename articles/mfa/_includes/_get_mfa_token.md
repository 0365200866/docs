Depending on when you are triggering enrollment, you can obtain an access token for using the MFA API in different ways: 

- If you are enrolling during authentication, check [Authenticating With Resource Owner Password Grant and MFA](/mfa/guides/mfa-api/authenticating).

- If you want to let the user enroll a factor at any moment, check [Managing MFA Enrollments](/mfa/guides/mfa-api/manage).
