# Auth0 Security Bulletin for Assigning Scopes Based on Email Address

## Overview

If you use rules to assign scopes to users based on their email address there is a possibility that scopes could be compromised if your application uses multiple connections.

Auth0 requires that email addresses are unique per connection, but not per application (client). Therefore, if you are using rules to assign scopes based on email address, and if a legitimate user A (`user_a@domain.com`) signs up via one connection, and a malicious user B signs up on a different connection using legitimate user A's email address, then malicious user B will get the same scopes as legitimate user A. This would result in two distinct users with the same email address and same scopes.

## Am I affected?

If you are using rules to assign scopes to users based on email address and you are using multiple connections per application, you may be vulnerable.

## How do I fix this?

In this scenario, the most straightforward mitigation is to require that users [verify their email address](/api/management/v2#!/Jobs/post_verification_email) before being able to complete the login process.
