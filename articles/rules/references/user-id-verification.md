# Integrate User ID Verification Services Using Rules

Auth0 allows integration with third-party vendors that offer identity verification. Such integration can be done by either connecting the third-party vendor as a federated identity provider using:

* OpenID Connect protocol
* SAML protocol
* Auth0 rules
 
## Configure a redirect rule with OnFido

Here is an example of an integration with OnFido (third-party vendor providing Document ID & Facial Biometrics Verification) using a [redirect rule](/rules/guides/redirect) in Auth0. 

1. Go to [**Rules > Create Rule**](${manage_url}/#/rules/new) and create a rule for OnFido.

2. Edit the rule settings. See the following example for the OnFido rule settings.

## User ID verification login experience

The authentication flow has the following steps:
1. An app initiates an authentication request to Auth0.
2. Auth0 routes the request to an Identity Provider through a configured connection.
3. The user authenticates successfully.
4. The [ID Token](/tokens/concepts/id-tokens) and/or <dfn data-key="access-token">Access Token</dfn> is passed through the Rules pipeline, then sent to the app.

The user will see the following screens when the third-party verification service is part of the authentication flow.

The user chooses to login with Google.

The login process then prompts the user to select a document to use to verify their identity.

After the user performs the steps to verify their identity, uploading documents and/or images, the verification service determines if the credentials are valid and then continues.

## Metadata example

The information of the OnFido verification is then stored in a userâ€™s app metadata within the Auth0 user profile.
