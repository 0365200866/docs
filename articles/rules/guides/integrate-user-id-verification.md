# Integrate User ID Verification Services Using Rules

Auth0 allows integration with third-party vendors that offer identity verification. Such integration can be done by either connecting the third-party vendor as a federated identity provider using either a [custom OIDC Connection](/connections/enterprise/oidc) or the [SAML protocol](/saml), or by using [Auth0 Rules](/rules).

In this example, you will integrate with OnFido, a third-party vendor providing Document ID and Facial Biometrics Verification, using a [redirect rule](/rules/guides/redirect) in Auth0.

## Prerequisites

Before connecting your Auth0 app to OnFido, you must [sign up for and configure your account with OnFido](https://onfido.com/us/).

## Steps

To connect your app to OnFido, you will:

1. [Get your OnFido credentials](#get-your-onfido-credentials)
2. [Create and activate a rule in Auth0](#create-and-activate-a-rule-in-auth0)

### Get your OnFido credentials

First, you will need to retrieve the URL of OnFido's API and your API Token. To learn how to do this, see [OnFido's Getting Started docs](https://documentation.onfido.com/#getting-started-with-api-v3).

Once you have retrieved the OnFido API's URL and your API Token, keep these values on hand because we will use them in the next step.

### Create and activate a rule in Auth0

[Set up a rule](articles/dashboard/guides/rules/create-rules) in Auth0. While setting up your rule, select the **Empty rule** template from the **Empty** section. For example code, see the following:

![Edit Auth0 OnFido Rule](/media/articles/rules/edit-onfido-rule.png)

 Use the following settings:

| Variable | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| url | OnFido API URL |
| token | OnFido API Token. You may use global variables to configure this in your rule. If so, be sure to [configure your rules variables](/dashboard/guides/rules/configure-variables) first. |

By default, your rule will be activated upon save.

## User ID verification login experience

The authentication flow contains the following steps:

1. An app initiates an authentication request to Auth0.
2. Auth0 routes the request to an Identity Provider through a configured connection.
3. The user authenticates successfully.
4. The [ID Token](/tokens/concepts/id-tokens) and/or <dfn data-key="access-token">Access Token</dfn> is passed through the Rules pipeline, then sent to the app.

The user will see the following screens when the third-party verification service is part of the authentication flow.

The user chooses to login with Google. 

![OnFido Verification Login Screen](/media/articles/rules/onfido-verification-login1.png)

The login process then prompts the user to select a document to use to verify their identity.

![OnFido Verify Identity](/media/articles/rules/onfido-verify-identity.png)

After the user performs the steps to verify their identity, uploading documents and/or images, the verification service determines if the credentials are valid and then continues.

## Metadata example

The information of the OnFido verification is then stored in a [userâ€™s app metadata](/users/concepts/overview-user-metadata) within the Auth0 user profile.
