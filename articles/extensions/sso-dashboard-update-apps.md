# Update Applications to the Auth0 Single Sign-On Dashboard

Use the [SSO Dashboard Extension](/extensions/sso-dashboard) to manage SSO login for your users on multiple enterprise applications. 

You can update applications that you have already [added to the SSO Dashboard](/extensions/sso-dashboard-add-apps).  

To edit an existing application go to the **Settings** page of the dashboard by clicking on the link on the upper right corner of the page and click **Settings** from the dropdown.

You can change whether users can see the application (if it is enabled) with the **Publish** or **Unpublish** buttons. 

You can delete an application with the **X** button, a confirmation box will popup to confirm the deletion.

To update an application's settings, click the gear icon.
