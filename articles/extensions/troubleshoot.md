# Troubleshoot Extensions

If you see issues with your [extensions](/extensions), we recommend that you begin the troubleshooting process with reinstalling the extension:

## Reinstall the extension

One of the first things you can do when running into issues with an extension is to reinstall it:

1. Go to [Dashboard > Extensions](${manage_url}/#/extensions).
2. On the **Installed Extensions** tab, delete the extension.
3. Log out of the Auth0 Dashboard.
4. Log back in to the Auth0 Dashboard.
5. Reinstall and reconfigure the extension.

## Contact Support

If you are still experiencing issues with your extensions, and you need to [contact support](https://support.auth0.com/), please be sure to **include errors logs and/or [real-time Webtask logs](/extensions/realtime-webtask-logs) with your support ticket**. Errors and logs can help Auth0 support troubleshoot your issue faster.
