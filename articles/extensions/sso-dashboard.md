# Auth0 Single Sign-On Dashboard Extension

With the **<dfn data-key="single-sign-on">Single Sign-on (SSO)</dfn> Dashboard** extension, you can enable SSO login for your users on multiple enterprise applications.

The SSO Dashboard supports two types of users: 
- **Users** who can login to the dashboard to select an application to sign into with SSO. 
- **Admins** who can configure applications visible to the users. 

Before you install and use the SSO Dashboard extension, you need to:

1. [Create an SSO Dashboard application](/extensions/sso-dashboard-create-app). 
2. [Install the extension](/extensions/sso-dashboard-install-extension).
3. [Add applications](/extensions/sso-dashboard-add-apps).
4. If necessary, [update applications](/extensions/sso-dashboard-update-apps).
