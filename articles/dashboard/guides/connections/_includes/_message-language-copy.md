<h3>Message language</h3>

<p>You can change the language for your SMS messages by using the <a href="/api/authentication/reference#get-code-or-link">`passwordless/start` endpoint</a> to set the `x-request-language` header to the language of your choice. If not set, the language used will be extracted from the <code>accept-language</code>header, which is automatically set for your browser.</p>
