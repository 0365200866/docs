<li>Adjust settings for your **OTP Expiry** and **OTP Length**.

<table>
<th><td>Parameter</td><td>Description</td></th>
<tr><td>OTP Expiry</td></td>Amount of time (in seconds) before the one-time-use code expires.</td></tr>
<tr><td>OTP Length</td><td>Character length of the one-time-use code.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>If you choose to extend the OTP expiry time, we recommend increasing the OTP length for security reasons. Otherwise, the malicious party has a longer time frame to try to guess an OTP that is shorter in length.</p></li>
