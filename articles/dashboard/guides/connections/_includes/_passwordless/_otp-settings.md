<li>Adjust settings for your <strong>OTP Expiry</strong> and <strong>OTP Length</strong>.</li>

| Parameter  | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| OTP Expiry | Amount of time (in seconds) before the one-time-use code expires. |
| OTP Length | Character length of the one-time-use code. |

::: warning
If you choose to extend the OTP Expiry time, then you should also increase the OTP Length. Otherwise, malicious parties have a longer timeframe to try to guess a short OTP, which increases security risks.
