# Set Up Passwordless Connections

This guide will show you how to set up a connection for [Passwordless Authentication](/connections/passwordless) using Auth0's Dashboard.

Before you begin, determine which method of passwordless authentication you would like to provide for your users: SMS or Email. Then choose the correct option below to learn how to configure the passwordless connection for that method:

<div class="code-picker">
  <div class="languages-bar">
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#sms" data-toggle="tab">SMS</a></li>
      <li><a href="#email" data-toggle="tab">Email</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="tab-content">
    <div id="sms" class="tab-pane active">
      <h2>SMS</h2>

::: panel Twilio Account
Before proceeding, you will need a valid Twilio account. Auth0 will use your [Twilio Application SID](https://www.twilio.com/help/faq/twilio-basics/what-is-an-application-sid) and [Auth Token](https://www.twilio.com/help/faq/twilio-basics/what-is-the-auth-token-and-how-can-i-change-it) to send SMS messages to users.

If you would like to use your own SMS gateway, you will first need to set up your passwordless connection to use Twilio and then modify the connection using our Management API. To learn how to modify the connection to use your own SMS gateway, see [Configure SMS Gateway for Passwordless Connections](/connections/passwordless/guides/use-sms-gateway-passwordless).

<ol>
<%= include('./_includes/_passwordless/_choose_method', {"method": "SMS"}) %>

<li>Enter your <strong>Twilio Account SID</strong> and <strong>Twilio Auth Token</strong>.</li>

::: note
To learn how to find your Twilio SID and Auth Token, see Twilio docs about the [Application SID](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223136607-What-is-an-Application-SID-) and [Auth Token](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223136027-Auth-Tokens-and-How-to-Change-Them).

<li>Select your <strong>SMS Source</strong>, which is the number your users will see as the sender of the SMS. If you've chosen <strong>Twilio Copilot</strong>, then enter your <strong>Twilio Messaging Service SID</strong>; otherwise, enter a <strong>From</strong> phone number.</li>

::: note
Twilio Copilot is an app that can improve your SMS delivery by providing phone number and content intelligence. To learn more about using Twilio Copilot with your Passwordless SMS messages, see [Sending Messages with Copilot](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest/sending-messages-copilot).
