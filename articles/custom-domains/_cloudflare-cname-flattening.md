::: panel Turn off Cloudflare CNAME Flattening
Cloudflare uses a feature called CNAME Flattening which affects Auth0 verification and certificate renewal in the way that it handles DNS records. We recommend that you turn off CNAME Flattening unless it's absolutely necessary. For details, see [Cloudflare documentation](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200169056-Understand-and-configure-CNAME-Flattening).
