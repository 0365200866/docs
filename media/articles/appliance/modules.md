# Node.js Modules Available in Rules and Custom Database Connections

For security reasons, rules and custom database connections for Auth0 appliances run in a JavaScript sandbox. You can use the full power of the ECMAScript 5 language and a few selected libraries.

The current sandbox supports:

* [auth0](https://github.com/auth0/node-auth0) _(2.0.0-alpha.5)_
* [Buffer](http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.10.24/api/buffer.html)
